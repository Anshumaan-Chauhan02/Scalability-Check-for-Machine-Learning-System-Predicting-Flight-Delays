<h4 align='center'> Project Description </h4> 
Machine learning algorithms have made tremendous progress recently and have been applied to various real-world problems. One of the applications also includes the task of predicting delays in Flight timings, which is one of the serious problems faced by the Airline business. However, the problem with machine learning models involving deep learning is that they need - high computational power systems to train and store the model. Additionally, the system needs to be made end to end scalable and is ignored by the trends in recent research. This paper discusses the approach we have used to predict the delay in flight by framing this as a prediction problem. Most of the research in machine learning goes into the part of predictive modeling. However, we focus on the end-to-end aspect of the problem by using industry-standard high-performance systems such as MySQL and SparkSQL. We show that our solution can not only be used for predictive modeling but also provides an end-to-end explanation of the whole product with faster real-time predictions and scalability. <br><br>

# 1) Install Spark / PySpark: (Assuming Mac OS)

### Install Homebrew
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

### Set brew to Path
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/admin/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

### Install OpenJDK 11
    brew install openjdk@11

### Install Scala (optional)
    brew install scala

### Install Python
    brew install python 

### Install Apache Spark
    brew install apache-spark
    
# Install Spark/PySpark  (Download links/documentations for OS - Windows, Linux, etc.)    

### Install Spark
    https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html 

### Install Python/Anaconda
    https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html

# 2) Install machine learning libraries (Assuming already configured anaconda installed)

### Install Pandas 
    conda install pandas

### Install Scikit-learn 
    pip install -U scikit-learn

### Install pytorch 
    Please refer website : https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

# 3) Installing of MySQL and the related connectors

### Install MySQL
    https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
    
### Install MySQL Connector
    https://jar-download.com/artifacts/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.48/source-code

# 4) Dataset (Available at Kaggle)
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses

# 5) Required changes in the Python file:  
  
  ### Spark Session Inialization:
            .config("spark.driver.extraClassPath","C:/Users/AnshumaanChauhan/Documents/spark-3.3.0-bin-hadoop3/spark-3.3.0-bin-hadoop3/jars/mysql-connector-java-5.1.48.jar")
  
  Here we need to change specified in this config attribute path to the Path in the system 
  
  ### Dataset Load Statement:
        dataset = spark.read.csv('C:\\Users\AnshumaanChauhan\\Documents\\Systems for DS Umass\\Project\\archive (5)\\DelayedFlights.csv',
                         header=True)
  
  Change the path specified in the load instruction to the path where dataset is stored in the system 
  
  ### Loading dataset into and from MySQL 
    updated_dataset.select(*(col(c) for c in dataset.columns)).write.format("jdbc") \
    .option("url", "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Sys") \
    .option("driver", "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").option("dbtable", "dataset") \
    .option("user", "root").option("password", "MySQL").save()
    
    updated_dataset = spark.read.format("jdbc") \
    .option("url", "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Sys") \
    .option("driver", "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").option("dbtable", "dataset") \
    .option("user", "root").option("password", "MySQL").load()
    
  In these statements change the value of "user" and "password" to the values specified during initializing of MySQL on the system 

###  File Description and Content 
     - MySQLQueries.sql file constits of the MySQL Analysis
     - SparkSQL_Queries_and_Python.py contains the code for PySpark analysis and visualizations using Matplotlib
     - models_for_delay_prediction.py file has the Machine Learning component of the Project
